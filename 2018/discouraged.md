# Losing Faith
I was feeling pretty annoyed about the state of the software industry last week and stumbled on this article: https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-more-people-work-as-programmers. Effectively, most people don't stay developers for very long because of two opposing factors: 1) it is waaaay too easy to get into a development career and 2) very few of those who do become developers have a positive impact on, well, just about anything. This has led to entire industries around trying to find, cultivate and retain talent. We keep trying to come up with processes to compensate for the lack of talent rather than address the real issue... because there's just too much demand.

## The birth of an elitists
An observation I've had is that your level of despair correlates to how much better you are at development than your peers. However, this isn't a solely hierarchical comparison -- you might look down on your peers for their woeful SQL skills while they might cry every time they look at your HTML. Occasionally, managers can find ways to draw attention to each team member's talents and avoid the team-wide disrespect I encounter so frequently.

Arrogance is a serious problem in the software industry. We work in a brutally honest environment. Our compiler constantly reminds us how dumb we are. Our PMs remind us how slow we are. QA takes pleasure in making us cry. Users can't understand why adding a button *takes sooo long*! No, if you're an arrogant developer, you're delusional. The problem is that most of us are paired up with teams that are pitiful. Compared to them, it's easy to start believing you're hot stuff. Before programmers call it quits altogether, it's not unusual for them jump jobs over and over hoping to find a company who appreciates them for just how special they are.

## Qualities
The truth is that there are a lot of factors (or qualities) that influence how valuable a developer is (in no particular order):

* Quality Oriented - How focused a developer is on producing quality code.
* Detail Oriented - How well a developer can think of and keep track of use cases.
* Adoption Rate - How quickly a developer can learn new skills or adopt coding practices.
* Communication - How good a developer is at keeping others informed.
* Humility - How willing a developer is to accept their limits *and share them with others*.
* Logical - How well a developer can organize their code.
* Multitasking - How many things a developer can keep in their heads at one time.
* Efficient - How focused a developer is on making code that performs well.
* Pattern matching - How quickly a developer can see patterns and think in terms of them.
* Creative - How frequently a developer finds inspiration and new ideas.
* Research Oriented - How willing a developer is to plan ahead or do "extracurricular" learning.
* Compartmental - How capable a developer is of looking at things at different levels of detail.
* Etc.

There are other skills that are harder.
